## Version 14.0.0 - September 3, 2020
Airship SDK 14 is a major update that prepares our automation module to support future IAA enhancements, revamps the Channel Capture tool, and provides other improvements.

The majority of apps will only be effected by the new `UrlAllowList` behavior changes.

## Changes
- **BEHAVIOR CHANGE** All URLs are not verified by default. Applications that use open URL action, landing pages, and custom in-app message image URLs will need to provide a list of URL patterns that match those URLs for SCOPE_OPEN_URL. The easist way to go back to 13.x behavior is to add `urlAllowListScopeOpenURL = *` to the AirshipConfig.
- Channel Capture tool now detects a `knock` of 6 app opens in 30 seconds. Instead of displaying anything to the user, the tool will write the current channel ID to the clipboard.
- Whitelist class and terminology removed and replaced with UrlAllowList.
- ActionAutomation and InAppMessageManager have been combined into InAppAutomation.
- InAppAutomation APIs have been updated to support future IAA enhancements. See migration guide for details.
- Removed deprecated APIs.
- Added sourcesJar maven artifact to each module, this allows browsing source code and java docs directly from Android Studio.

### Changes
- Use standard window insets for banners instead of root insets.

### Changes
- Added Named User attributes.
- Fixed NPE when retrying a failed video URL in IAA after the view has been detached from the window.

the `urbanairship-core` module into several modules: `urbanairship-core`, `urbanairship-message-center`, `urbanairship-automation`, and

  by adding metadata to the manifest with key `com.urbanairship.INSTALL_NETWORK_SECURITY_PROVIDER`.

### Changes

### Packages

  and/or `urbanairship-adm` instead.
- Preferences (com.urbanairhsip.preferences) have been moved into their own

### Other
- Updated APIs for better kotlin interop support.

display of push notifications. Apps that disable early take off should update.

### Changes
- Fixed PersistableBundle NPE.
- Fixed ChannelCapture tool sometimes throwing an exception.
- Attempt automatic take off when receiving a new push or token from FCM.

Patch to fix an issue where if two in-app messages have an audience condition for the same tag group,
only the newest tag group will be requested properly. Apps that use in-app automation should update.

Apps that use in-app automation with version triggers or audience conditions should update.

### Changes
- Fixed JsonMatcher scope parsing.


## Version 9.4.0 - July 19, 2018

Minor release that adds new NotificationFactory APIs to better handle limited background
time when building notifications. This release also addresses ANRs from the GCM and ADM
Broadcast Receiver that occur when notification building takes longer than 10 seconds when
using a custom notification factory. To avoid the ANR, the braodcast will wait a max of 10
seconds before finishing received broadcast instead of waiting for the notification to
finish. This will prevent the ANR from occurring, but the OS might kill the app before it
has time to display the notification and it will be lost. To avoid this issue, either use
`NotificationFactory#createNotificationResult(PushMessage, int, boolean)` to retry later
if the notification is taking too long, or use `NotificationFactory#requiresLongRunningTask(PushMessage)`
if the notification requires more than 10 seconds.

### Changes
- Deprecated `NotificationFactory#createNotificationResult(PushMessage, int)` in favor of `NotificationFactory#createNotificationResult(PushMessage, int, boolean)` that also tells the factory if it has longer than 10 seconds to build the notification.
- Added listener to the Whitelist class to reject URLs.
- Added method to generate AirshipConfigOptions from a Properties instance.
- Fixed ANRs caused by slow notification builds in custom factories when using GCM or ADM modules.
- Fixed issue where HTML in-app automation messages were cancelled instead being displayed.

it would mark it as expired during the next app init, even if the schedule was not still current. Any app
using either action automation or in-app messages should update.

### Changes
- Fixed marking current schedules with an end time as expired.

## Version 9.3.1 - June 15, 2018

Fixed issues with in-app automation not displaying due to the display being paused by default. Apps
that use in-app automation should update.

Rate App Action crashing on Marshmallow and older devices. Applications that use the rate
app action should update.

updates. For FCM migration, please follow the [FCM Migration Guide](https://github.com/urbanairship/android-library/blob/main/documentation/migration/migration-guide-fcm.md).

### Changes
- Added support for FCM Google Play Services dependency.
- When using `urbanairship-fcm`, setting the FCM sender ID in the airship config options is now optional.
- Moved push providers into own packages - `urbanairship-fcm`, `urbanairship-gcm`, `urbanairship-adm`,
  and `urbanairship-core`. The package `urbanairship-sdk` still exists and is now just a wrapper package
  that depends on gcm, adm, and core to prevent breaking apps.
- Deprecated `urbanairship-sdk` and `urbanairship-gcm` packages. They will be dropped in SDK release 10.0.
- Updated in-app message designs.

  if it has been scheduled during an active session instead of waiting for the next
  foreground.

to prevent pulling in the architecture components. Applications that want to use 26.1.0 can continue
to do so by defining 26.1.0 in the app's build.gradle file. The SDK is still fully compatible with 26.1.0.

### Changes
- Change support library version to 26.0.2.


## Version 8.9.3 - October 17, 2017

  both modes.
- Made the Timer class public for in-app messaging customization.
- Updated Google Play Services to 11.4 and Support Library to 26.1.0

### Deprecations

### New Features
- Exposed the in-app message display timer on the InAppMessageFragment.

## Version 8.7.0 - July 18, 2017

### New Features
- Added a fallback job scheduler using the Android Jobs API for Lollipop+ devices when the GcmNetworkManager
  is unavailable. By default, Urban Airship will schedule jobs with Ids between 3000000 - 3000099.
  The start ID can be changed from 3000000 by adding metadata to the AndroidManifest.xml with
  a new start ID under the key `com.urbanairship.job.JOB_ID_START`. The new scheduler can also be prioritized
  over the GcmNetworkManger scheduler by adding metadata `com.urbanairship.job.PREFER_ANDROID_JOB_SCHEDULER`
  with the value `true`.
- Added ability to disable the GcmNetworkManger scheduler by adding the metadata `com.urbanairship.job.DISABLE_GCM_SCHEDULER`
  with the value `false` to the AndroidManifest.xml.


### Bug Fixes

- Added support for setting the notification channel per push from the push API.
- Added a default notification channel. Currently the default channel's name and description is only
  available in english. Other localizations will be provided in an SDK update.

### Behavior Changes
- Android O devices will only have 10 seconds to process a push notification. Custom notification factories
  that require more time can implement `public boolean requiresLongRunningTask(PushMessage message)` to have
  the SDK schedule a job to process the notification when the application has more than 10 seconds.
- Listening for location updates no longer keeps the LocationService alive in the background and is
  only supported on the main process.
- Push messages that are associated with a message center message will no longer wait for the inbox
  to be refreshed. Custom message center implementations should be updated to handle the message
  not being available when the user tries to deep link to the message.
- Fetching images for a big picture notification style will timeout after 10 seconds. If the image times out,
  the notification will be posted without the big picture style.

- Fixed tag actions predicates from being applied.

   in Urban Airship API calls.

   ID's messages will be handled by Urban Airship. The rest will be ignored.
 - Simplified push integration. The push intent receiver is now optional and the library
   supports automatically launching the application if the push intent receiver is not
   set or does not handle the open notification broadcasts.
 - A new default notification factory that uses the Big Text notification style.
 - User notifications can be disabled without disabling push. This allows the application
   to still be messaged when notifications are disabled.

   to parse the intents and provide convenient listener style callbacks.

   launch the application in the push intent receiver.

  established.
